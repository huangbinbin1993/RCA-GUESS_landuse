The vegetation surface resistance according to Equation \ref{eq:rsv} is

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rsvb}
  r_{sv} = \frac{r_{svmin}}{\mathrm{LAI}} F_1 F_2^{-1} F_3^{-1} F_4^{-1} F_5^{-1}.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To account for different
soil moisture and temperature conditions in different root layers the common factor $F_2^{-1} F_5^{-1}$ is calculated
individually for each soil layer which in combination with the other factors actually gives
different $r_{sv}$-values for each soil layer. As shown in Figure \ref{soilsurfres} these individual
resistances are coupled in parallell, also including the aerodynamic resitance $r_b$ (forest case),
which gives a weighted value according to

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rsvweight}
\begin{array}{ll}
  \Frac{1}{r_b + r_{sv}} & = \Frac{Fr_{root1}}{r_b + r_{sv1}} + \Frac{Fr_{root2}}{r_b + r_{sv2}} + \Frac{Fr_{root3}}{r_b + r_{sv3}} = \\
\ \\
 & \frac{Fr_{root1}}{r_b + \frac{r_{svmin}}{\mathrm{LAI}} F_1 F_3^{-1} F_4^{-1} F_{21}^{-1} F_{51}^{-1}} +
\frac{Fr_{root2}}{r_b + \frac{r_{svmin}}{\mathrm{LAI}} F_1 F_3^{-1} F_4^{-1} F_{22}^{-1} F_{52}^{-1}} +
\frac{Fr_{root3}}{r_b + \frac{r_{svmin}}{\mathrm{LAI}} F_1 F_3^{-1} F_4^{-1} F_{23}^{-1} F_{53}^{-1}} = \\
\ \\
 & \left\{ \frac{1}{zqq}= \frac{r_{svmin}}{\mathrm{LAI}} F_1 F_3^{-1} F_4^{-1} \right\} = \\
\ \\
 & \Frac{Fr_{root1} zqq F_{21} F_{51}}{1+r_b zqq F_{21} F_{51}} + 
 \Frac{Fr_{root2} zqq F_{22} F_{52}}{1+r_b zqq F_{22} F_{52}} +
 \Frac{Fr_{root3} zqq F_{23} F_{53}}{1+r_b zqq F_{23} F_{53}} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $Fr_{root}$ represents the fractional distribution of roots between the three soil layers
as described in Section \ref{sec:rootdistribution}.
