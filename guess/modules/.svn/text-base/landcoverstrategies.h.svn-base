/// \brief Classes for handling the different land cover schemes we support.
///
/// We use the abstract factory design pattern here to give a flexible system for 
/// dealing with different land cover schemes. There's a global LandCoverStrategy
/// (which can be for instance a PNV strategy if we simulate Potential Natural 
/// Vegetation, or an ECOCLIMAP strategy). This global object is used to create
/// objects that keep track of the land cover fractions for each gridcell.
///
/// To support new land cover schemes in the future, implement a new LandCoverStrategy
/// sub-class.
///
/// The I/O module is responsible for setting the current LandCoverStrategy, based
/// on what's chosen in the ins file.

/// Abstract base class for keeping track of land cover fractions for a single grid cell
/** 
 *  This class defines the interface for classes that, in different ways, handle
 *  the land cover fractions for a single grid cell.
 *
 *  The interface makes available the following variables:
 *
 *  fgrid_land  - Fraction of this grid cell that is land (static)
 *  fland_crop  - Fraction of LAND that is non-forest vegetation due to land use
 *  fland_bare  - Fraction of LAND that is non-vegetated
 *
 *  The latter two can vary with the calendar year.
 *
 *  This makes it possible to implement various schemes, from simple PNV
 *  (Potential Natural Vegetation), where fland_crop and fland_bare are always
 *  0, and fgrid_land is the value we get from RCA, to more sophisticated
 *  implementations where the fractions are read from file and change each year.
 *
 *  Objects implementing this interface should not be created directly, but rather
 *  by calling get_landcoverinfo() for the currently enabled LandCoverStrategy
 *  (see below).
